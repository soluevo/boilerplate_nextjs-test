This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Getting Started 

Thank you for participating in this exercise. 

This exercise is supposed to be done in about 4 hours, after that time, no submissions will be considered. 

You have to create a branch in our github, you cannot fork it or clone the Master.

There is a test page for you to see that the code is working, you can delete this page and create the new one to replace it.


## Objectives

You must do a react or angular replica of this page:

Important Notes: 

Your solution has to be renderable on pc, tablet and cell phone;

All button effects have to be done, the grid should functional and mocked, with images and pagination.

You should use clean code and global css to change colors, but don't put css in the code, because good programing practices are very important. 





# React JS Boilerplate

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
